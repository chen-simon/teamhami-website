#### Hello reader!

I'm Simon Chen, and I'm planning on making a full Steam release in the next year so I'm just setting up this website and getting together a small team. The plan is to work on the game with a few of the amazing people I have met when being the project lead on [Cooking With a Gun](https://chensimon.itch.io/cooking-with-a-gun). We're gonna cook something amazing very soon so stay tuned for more!
